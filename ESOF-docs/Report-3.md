## Development View

This is a view of a system’s architecture that encompasses the components used to
assemble and release a physical system. This view focuses on configuration management
and actual software module organization in the development environment. The software is
actually packaged into components that can be developed and tested by the development
team. While the Logical View is at the conceptual level, the diagrams in this view
represent the physical-level artifacts that are built by the team.
