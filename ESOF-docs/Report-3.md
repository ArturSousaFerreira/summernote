## Development View

The development view illustrates a system from a programmer's perspective and is concerned with software management. This view is also known as the implementation view. It uses the UML Component diagram to describe system components.

This is a view of a system’s architecture that encompasses the components used to
assemble and release a physical system. This view focuses on configuration management
and actual software module organization in the development environment. The software is
actually packaged into components that can be developed and tested by the development
team. While the Logical View is at the conceptual level, the diagrams in this view
represent the physical-level artifacts that are built by the team.

Component Diagrams are used to represent the Implementation View. These diagrams
show different components, the ports available and the dependencies on the environment
in terms of provided and required interfaces. UML 2 has improved the Component
Diagrams specifically with the interfaces and ports. The components can be tied to the
classes and composite structures that realize these components. These diagrams can
now be used to precisely represent the software components built in a system and their
dependencies both in black-box and white-box views.
