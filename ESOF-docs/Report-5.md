## Introduction

Since Summernote is a project still growing and evolving, there is still 
a large list of tasks and features to be developed and problems to be corrected. 
However, the project is open to the development of new features as long 
as its interest for the relevant project. Throughout this report will 
be described the process of identification, development and submission 
of a new feature of the Summernote project.
