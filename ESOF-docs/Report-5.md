## Introduction

Since Summernote is a project still growing and evolving, there is still 
a large list of tasks and features to be developed and problems to be corrected. 
However, the project is open to the development of new features as long 
as it interest for the relevant project. Throughout this report will 
be described the process of identification, development and submission 
of a new feature of the Summernote project.

## Discuss Software Maintainability

We have ran the Better Codehub, later we call only BC, tool to check ten guidelines for maintainable software
in the Summernote project.

We present below the results this tool provided in the same order presented to us. 

1. :x: Write Short Units of Code
2. :x: Write Simple Units of Code
3. :x: Write Code Once
4. :heavy_check_mark: Keep unit interfaces small
5. :heavy_check_mark: Separate concerns in modules
6. :heavy_check_mark: Couple Architecture Components Loosely
7. :heavy_check_mark: Keep architecture components balanced
8. :heavy_check_mark: Keep your codebase small
9. :x: Automate Tests
10. :heavy_check_mark: Write clean code

We have notice a classification of compliance of 6 of 10, in such a way that we've got 
a badge of [![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/ei12134/summernote)](https://bettercodehub.com)
which proves the respective classification.

To get more detailed information we provide [here](resources/BetterCodeHub.pdf) a link to a pdf file that shows the
ten guidelines in a more evident and list layout way.

## Report evolution process

1. Briefly describe how the feature you decided to evolve was identified;
2. why you decide to evolve that particular feature? 
3. How did you locate the parts in the source code that needed to be modified.
