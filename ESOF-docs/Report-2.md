## Domain Model 

The domain model is a representation of meaningful real-world concepts pertinent to the domain that need to be modeled in software. Generally uses the vocabulary of the domain so that a representation of the model can be used to communicate with non-technical stakeholders.

It seems to us that we are in the presence of an application that have a very simple Domain Model.


Packages that seem to exist in our application are:
- Webserver
- Plugins
- Tools (external tools)
