## Introduction

In this report we will look at Summernote with concern to software testing. In the first section we will analyze the testability of the project, how 
easy it is to test the different components of the text editor, and how these test methods could be improved. Next, some test statistics of the project 
will be presented, number of tests, coverage, among other aspects. Finally, the process of correcting a bug reported in the project will be reported.

## Software Testability and Reviews

There are many definitions of the software testability and different papers have given
different types of software testability factors and metrics on different perspective. 

We are the opinion that software testability is the degree to which a software
artifact facilitates testing in a given test context. It is directly related to
test effort reduction. A lack of testability, like other design faults, is expensive
to repair when detected late during software development. Therefore, testability
should be addressed already during reviews of early development artifacts.

It is really difficult task to get all the clear view of factors that can
affect the software testability with their dominating degree on the software system.
Even though, we collected six of the factors that affect the software
testability, presented below.


##### 1. Controllability

Controllability is one of the most important factors of testability. Controllability is the ease of producing a specific output from a specific 
inputâ€”related to the effective coverage of the declared output domain from the input domain. In other words, it is the ability to control input and 
execution of a component/software under test as required for testing.

Analyzing Summernote, we can define controllability as the extent to which a component is constructed to provide component control capability to 
facilitate the control of components. Component control capability includes the following types:

- Component environment control: This refers to the built-in component capability that supports component environment installation, setup, and 
deployment.
- Component execution control: This refers to the built-in component execution control capability that enables executions of a component in different 
modes, such as test mode, normal function mode, and control mode. With this capability, users and testers can start, restart, stop, pause, and abort a program execution as they wish. 
- Component state-based behavior control: This refers to the built-in capability that facilitates the control of component state-based behavior, such 
as resetting component states, triggering a state transaction from one state to another. 
- Component test control: This refers to the built-in capability that facilitates the control of component tests through component interfaces. Setting 
up different input parameter data for component tests is a typical example. 
- Component function feature control: This refers to the built-in capability that facilitates the selection and configuration of component functional 
features. It is only applicable to software components with customizable functional features that allow component users to select and configure its 
features based on their needs.

Since these control capabilities are essential for supporting component testing and operations, component controllability is an important contributing 
factor for component testability. To increase component controllability, component developers need to learn how to construct software components with 
high controllability. The major challenge for them is that they are used to applying specific approaches to supporting program controllability at a 
certain level to meet the specific requirements for program control and test control. They need well-defined software controllability concepts and 
supporting methodology to help them address component controllability in all phases of a component-based software engineering process. 


##### 2. Observability

Software observability indicates how easy it is to observe a program based on its operational behaviors, input parameter values, and actual outputs for 
a test case. The same concept is also applicable to software components to check observability based on component interfaces to see the mapping 
relationships between the inputs and corresponding outputs. 
Software component is observable if distinct outputs are generated from distinct inputs so that, if a test input is repeated, the output is the same. 
If the outputs are not the same, then the component is dependent on hidden states not identified by the tester - input inconsistency. 
In our view, component observability refers to the degree to which components are designed to facilitate the monitoring and observation of component 
functions and behaviors of component tests. Component observability is twofold: 

- check the mapping relationships between inputs and corresponding outputs for each test. This could be done in two different stages. A test design 
review is the first stage, in which all component tests are verified to find the hidden inputs and missing outputs, and incorrect mapping relationships 
between inputs and outputs. Test result verification during component testing is the second stage, where an effective test tool could be an ideal 
solution to check this in a systematic manner. 
- track and monitor all component tests and test results. There are two ways to achieve this goal. An effective component test bed is a natural 
solution. To reduce the testing cost in setting up a specific component test bed for each component, we need to find effective methods to construct 
testable components with good observability.

##### 3. Isolateability

Isolateablity is the degree to which the component under test can be tested in isolation.

Building and testing each function in isolation gives a more accurate idea in case of error. If we just hope to see everything work out at the end, we 
will see that in case of error, testing and debugging will be a painful process. When problems are encountered, it can be difficult to figure out where 
in the hierarchy of functions that originated.

It is much better if each routine or class can be exercised as soon as it is written, and before being combined with other parts.

If we can control the inputs and observe the outputs of a single function, it is relatively easy to find out what this function did. If we can only 
observe the operation of the entire program, it can be very difficult to find out where an incorrect result came from.

There may be some components that can not be tested in perfect isolation but if there is a partial ordering of functionality tests that allows us to 
test all other subcomponents first, we can be sure that new problems are in the new code.

##### 4. Separation of concerns

The separation of concerns is keeping the code for each of these concerns 
separate. Changing the interface should not require changing the business 
logic code, and vice versa.

Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is an excellent example of 
separating these concerns for better software maintainability.

##### 5. Understandability

Software systems tend to depart more and more from the
principle of simplicity and become increasingly complex.
The increase in size and complexity of software drastically
affects several quality attributes, especially understandability
and maintainability. Software developers and
maintainers need to read and understand source programs
and other documents of software. The significance
of understandability is very obvious that can be perceived
as `If we can't learn something, we won't understand it. If
we can't understand something, we can't use it - at least
not well enough to avoid creating a money pit. We can't
maintain a system that we don't understand - at least not
easily. And we can't make changes to our system if we
can't understand how the system as a whole will work
once the changes are made`. Understandability of
software documents is thus important as `the better we
know what the thing is supposed to do, the better we can
test for it`.

Software understandability is vital and one of the most
significant components of the software development. The
lack of understandability aspect often leads to false interpretation
that may in turn lead to ambiguities, misunderstanding
and hence to faulty development results. 
It plays an important role as far as the issue of delivering
quality software is concerned. Therefore, Understandability
is obviously relevant and significant in the
context of software testability. The model has been validated
theoretically as well as empirically using experimental
try-out. 


##### 6. Heterogeneity

Summernote is an open-source library under the MIT license as had been said 
previously, and have some contributions on github from various developers.
It represent a risk of embedding the modified code submitted in a pull request,
and made the integration with the existent code so is necessary to ensure that
it remains globally functional.

By one side, the unit tests allows the owners and the contributors of 
Summernote's project guarantee the correct operation of library components and
the right flow of development. 
On the other hand, it is important to verify if the integration of the
various components is done correctly through integration tests. As already
mentioned, the Grunt tool is used to automate Unit tests and the 
Travis-CI tool is used to automate
Integration tests.


It is verified that the use of a public GitHub repository open to
any collaborator encourages a greater heterogeneity of the test tools used.

## Identify a new bug and/or correct a bug
Reading the issues available at the git repository for the Summernote project and filtering the results using the `bug` tag allowed us to access a useful list of unresolved bugs already found and detailed by the community. After some time navigating through this list we decided to attempt to correct a bug disclosed at the beginning of November 2016 by the user `1002237913` concerning the text editor command for reseting the foreground text color. The referred #2125 issue is titled [ForeColor ResetToDefault](https://github.com/summernote/summernote/issues/2125) and explains the expected behaviour of the action of reseting the foreground color of a text involving the reversion of its color to the original one, while preserving any other text formatting previously applied like bold, italic, etc. In reality, Summernote's current build does not respect this and the `Reset to default` command actually also removes any extra text formatting along with reseting the its color. This was a bug acknowledged by the team developer [`lqez`](http://summernote.org/team/) and also tagged the issue as `pull-request-wanted`. The apparent simple nature of the bug and the fact that there was a deliberate request to get a fix by the community from a team developer made us attempt to fix the bug and open a [pull request](https://github.com/summernote/summernote/pull/2138). Our initial solution was mere line change that made the reset command only change the text color to black along the lines of a suggestion of the initial bug reporter. This was unfortunately not enough as `lqez` expressed that we should get the real reset color which in some cases could not be black, meaning we needed to figure the default text color defined somewhere in the program code. After some css style analysis we arrived at a possible solution that retrieves the original css color applied to the text and uses that value when issuing the reset color command. After each new commit amending the original pull-request, two checks are made: `coveralls` tests and displays the new code coverage status after the changes in the source code and `travis-ci` checks for integration errors including syntax and code formating errors. At the time of writing of this report, no new comments were added to that pull-request.
